    真菌作为生态系统中的分解者，在木质纤维素的分解中发挥着重要作用，促进生态系统中的碳循环。本文通过建立数学模型来模拟真菌的分解过程，在不考虑真菌之间相互作用的情况下，通过线性回归模型分析湿度和温度对真菌分解速率的影响。结合微分方程和元细胞自动机模型，考虑真菌之间的相互作用来描述不同种群的真菌在给定环境中如何相互作用。

# patent:

#   title: Patents
#   description: |
#     The patent section in a resume is a dedicated section where you can showcase any patents that you have been granted or are in the process of obtaining. This section is particularly relevant for individuals who work in scientific or technical fields, as well as for individuals who have developed innovative products or technologies.

#     In this section, you should list the title of the patent, the name of the inventors, the patent number, and the date it was granted. If the patent is pending, you can indicate that it is "pending" or "in review." You may also want to provide a brief description of the technology or invention that the patent covers.

#     Including a patent section in your resume can help demonstrate your expertise and accomplishments in your field, and can help you stand out from other candidates. However, if you do not have any patents to list, it is not necessary to include this section in your resume.

#     Template for a pending patent:

#     + [Inventor Name]. [Pursued Year]. [Title]. [Patent Number], filed [Submitted Date]. Patent pending.

#     Template for an approved patent:

#     + [Inventor Name]. [Pursued Year]. [Title]. [Patent Number], filed [Submitted Date], [Received Date].

#     The following are some examples of patent formats.

#     + Foo Bar. 2022. Example patent name one. US 123456, filed Oct 3, 2022. Patent pending.
#     + Foo Bar. 2022. Example patent name two. US 654321, filed Oct 3, 2022, and issued Nov 15, 2022.

# organization:

#   title: Organizations
#   description: |
#     The organization section in a resume, specifically for social contexts, is a section where you can showcase any relevant involvement or leadership positions in social, cultural, or community organizations. This section can highlight your commitment to social causes and your ability to work collaboratively with others towards a common goal.

#     In this section, you can list the name of the organization, your role and responsibilities, the duration of your involvement, and any significant achievements or accomplishments. You can also mention any skills or qualities you gained from your involvement, such as leadership, teamwork, communication, or problem-solving skills.

#     This section can be especially valuable for candidates seeking positions in the non-profit sector, social work, or community engagement roles, where experience in social or cultural organizations can demonstrate a genuine passion for social causes and a willingness to work collaboratively towards social change. However, it is important to only include organizations that are relevant to the job you are applying for, and avoid listing organizations that may be controversial or potentially offensive.

# evaluation:

#   order: 13
#   title: Self-evaluation
#   description: |
#     The self-evaluation section in a resume is a section where you can evaluate and assess your own skills, strengths, and weaknesses. It is typically a short paragraph or bullet points at the end of your resume, which provides a personal perspective on your abilities and how they align with the requirements of the job.

#     In this section, you can highlight your achievements, areas of expertise, and any unique qualities or experiences that set you apart from other candidates. You can also mention areas where you are looking to improve or gain further experience.

#     A well-crafted self-evaluation section can demonstrate your self-awareness and confidence in your abilities, as well as your willingness to continuously learn and grow. However, it is important to be honest and avoid over-inflating your skills or qualifications, as this can negatively impact your credibility and the hiring manager's impression of you.

# reference:
#   show: true
#   order: 14
#   title: References
#   description: |
#     A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

#     It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

#     When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

#     It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
