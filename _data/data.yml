#     Fungi, as decomposers in the ecosystem, play an important role in the decomposition of lignocellulose and promote the carbon cycle in the ecosystem. In this paper, the decomposition of fungi was simulated by establishing a mathematical model, and the effects of humidity and temperature on the decomposition rate of fungi were analyzed by linear regression model without considering the interaction between fungi. Combined with differential equations and metacellular automata model, the interaction between fungi was considered to describe how different populations of fungi interact in a given environment.
